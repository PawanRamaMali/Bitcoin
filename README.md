<summary> What is the role of Bitcoin Miners  ? </summary>
<br/>

A group of people are called miners, who process and confirm bitcoin transactions using powerful bitcoin mining computers which solve cryptography math problems because of which they are rewarded in Bitcoin.

Their key role is to build the blockchain of records that forms the Bitcoin ledger.

<summary> What are Hash functions  ? </summary>
<br/>

A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. The values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table.
A function that converts a given big phone number to a small practical integer value. The mapped integer value is used as an index in the hash table. In simple terms, a hash function maps a big number or string to a small integer that can be used as the index in the hash table. 

Blocks in a Blockchain are linked to each other through the process of cryptographic hashing. Each block is cryptographically hashed and includes the hash from the previous block as part of the hash, this makes it very easy to see if anyone has tampered with any block as changing the value of a hash for a block will automatically "break the chain" and make all the blocks after that block invalid.

<summary> The Four Fundamental Components of Bitcoin  ? </summary>
<br/>

* Software
* Cryptography
* Hardware
* Miners (Gaming Theory)
 
* Bitcoin software creates the task and than give to the miners to solve it!
* This task or challenge will take approximately 10 minutes to be completed!
* Every single miner starts to find that Nonce which will validate the hash of block
* At a moment One of the miner with higher speed and great hardware specs will win the match but the match will go till 10 minutes.
* No one is loser!
* All the community will start verifying that block which is mined by the winner.
* It will end up by being the new block that will be added to blockchain.
* This is both competition and co-opetition .
* Winner will be paid by 12.5 Btc and that's how new bitcoin is created!

<summary> What is Disintermediation ? </summary>
<br/>

Disintermediation is the process of reducing or eliminating intermediaries (i.e.. "middle-men") between parties in a transaction. The fact that Bitcoin enables the exchange of value between two parties directly over the Internet without requiring the services of a bank or some other institution is an example of disintermediation.

<summary> What is a Bitcoin Fork ? </summary>
<br/>

Bitcoin forks are defined variantly as changes in the protocol of the bitcoin network or as the situations that occur "when two or more blocks have the same block height". A fork influences the validity of the rules. ... Forks require consensus to be resolved or else a permanent split emerges.
